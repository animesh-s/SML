# Vandalism Detection in Wikipedia

## Problem Statement

We plan to identify the cases of vandalism on Wikipedia articles by classifying edits as either *regular* or *vandalism*. This is clearly a Binary Classification task, but because of the skewed distribution of regular and vandalism cases in the dataset, we will also explore if this can be modeled as an Anomaly Detection problem.

## Dataset

We will use the corpus of vandalism cases found on Wikipedia which is available [here]
(http://www.uni-weimar.de/en/media/chairs/webis/corpora/pan-wvc-10/). The corpus consists of 32452 edits on 28468 Wikipedia articles among which 2391 edits have been labeled as vandalism, while the rest are labeled as regular.

## Experimental Setup

### Algorithms

We plan to implement these algorithms for the Binary Classification task: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear and Radial Basis Kernel Support Vector Machine and Random Forest.
We can also model this problem as an Anomaly Detection task and implement the One-class Support Vector Machine and Isolation Forest. For the Feature Selection task, we plan to use Principal Component Analysis.

### Parameter Tuning

Nu - For the One-class SVM

Gamma - For the Radial Basis Kernel

C - For the Linear and Radial Basis Kernels

Alpha - Smoothing parameter for Multinomial Naive Bayes

NumTree - Number of trees for Random Forest

MaxDepth - Max depth of tree for Random Forest

L2 - Regularization parameter for Logistic Regression

Weâ€™ll use k-fold cross-validation for tuning these parameters and split the dataset randomly into training and testing sets with 80% reserved for training and the rest of 20% for testing.

### Experimental Plots

We plan to plot these graphs to validate our experiments: Parameter Values vs F Measure, PR curves and ROC curves to measure the accuracy and F Measure of the tests.
